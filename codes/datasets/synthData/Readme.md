All synthetic datasets are uploaded to the ["Mendeley Data" data center](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/p4tx2k852r/4), and have been crafted through MATLAB for various experimental purposes. There are 4 datasets for the __"Accuracy and Stability Analysis"__ experiment, 11 datasets for the __"Tolerance to a High Number of Outliers"__ experiment, and finally, 10 datasets for the __"Scalability test"__. In all these artificial datasets, there are different types of Gaussian clusters along with some specific amount of outliers injected around them.

More information on the essence of these artificially generated datasets and the way they have been created is available along with the corresponding datasets in the presented link; you can find more details in the associated paper.
